Hi everyone!

This is Syeda Mansur Irene, mother of a 6 years old beautiful boy. I am hoping to start loving programming one day so here's my first effort in doing so!

Hope I succeed. Also, soon I am going to start my Masters in either Information Technology Management or Software Engineering at University of Malaya so brushing up my long lost knowledge. I graduated from National University of Singapore as an Electrical Engineer 7 long years ago!
